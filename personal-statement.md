I want to be in the program because I want to learn how to do research.
I want to do research because I want to be at the cutting edge of
something. I want to be at the cutting edge of AI in particular because
I think it's easily the most important technology, since it could lead
to automatic discovery of others.

I'm interested in reinforcement learning in particular. I want to
understand intelligence, and the parallels to human intelligence in RL
draw me to it.

I have a math background, going all the way up to measure theory and
functional analysis. AI attracted my interest after the world's worst
Tinder date led to a subarachnoid hemorrhage and 2 weeks in the
hospital. I spent that time thinking about what I could do that would
have the most impact on the world, and AI came out on top, edging out
bioengineering.

I spent my senior year of college taking or auditing courses in
reinforcement learning and statistical learning theory. I went to the
Recurse Center the summer after, and studied and implemented several
deep RL algorithms.

I want to work in a team on important problems, which is why the AI
residency attracts me. Working by myself is not as efficient, and the
things I can do alone are much more limited.

During and after the residency, I want to learn how to do good research.
Afterwards, I plan to apply for a PhD in computer science.
