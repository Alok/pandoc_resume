## Education and Coursework

2013-2017

:   **BA, Mathematics**; University of California, Berkeley

    Deep Reinforcement Learning (CS 294), Machine Learning (CS 189),
    Topics in Deep Learning (CS 294-113), Topology and Measure Theory
    (MATH 202A), Artificial Intelligence (CS 188), Algorithms (CS 170)

## Relevant Experience

**Resident, Recurse Center** (2017)

Worked on deep reinforcement learning. Implemented DAgger, Deep
Q-Networks, and Trust Region Policy Optimization.

Also worked on metaheuristics such as genetic algorithms and simulated
annealing.

**Data Scientist Intern, Radius Intelligence (2015)**

-   Found a security vulnerability and had it fixed.
-   Noticed that customer data was not being used. Integrated it,
    increasing total dataset size by 3x.

## Relevant Projects

**Deep Q-Network**

Implemented DQN to play Atari games (Pong and Breakout).

**DAgger**

Implemented and gave a talk about DAgger at Recurse Center.

**Trust Region Policy Optimization**

Implemented TRPO optimization.

**Genetic Algorithm to optimize hyperparameters for neural nets**

Found optimal parameters for architecture 10x faster than brute search.

**Phylogenetic Tree Construction**

Built a phylogenetic tree using a modified Jukes-Cantor method.

**Tomographic Reconstruction**

Reconstructed 3D images of protein tertiary structure from 2D
projections by applying Fourier analysis.

**MAS approximator**

Wrote an approximation algorithm for the maximum acyclic subgraph
problem.

## Skills

-   Python, Keras, Tensorflow, Haskell, `bash`, Vimscript, Apache Spark
